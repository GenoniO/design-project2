        <h1>Paints</h1>
        <p class="paint">Because the artists were creating, the materials they used vary a bunch. In the earlier days,
            the paints they used were mainly naturally based. Such as pigments from stones and minerals mixed with oils to make oil paint.
             Charcoal has always been used since forever for underpaintings and sketches and studies. As oil paint became popular, and new
             materials where found, artists could now use pastels (oil based) and pencils. In newer times, artists use acrylic paints, made
             with less natural materials, and dries faster in contrast to oil paint which takes several days even a week to dry. In present day,
              all materials for paint can be used and spray paint is a new addition.

        <H1>Brushes</H1>
        <p class="paint">Just like the paints, the brushes that artists use, change material depending on the era. In the earlier times,
            the brush bristles were made from animal hairs like bigs, horses, and donkeys. The stems of the brushes were made of wood
            and bound to the bristles with string or glues, which would sooner be replaced with glue and metal. Other tools like sponges where used
            as well. Later on, materials for brushes where changed to plastic fibers and plastic rods, but today top quality brushes are still made
            from hairs and wooden poles.

        <h1>Sculpting</h1>
        <p class="paint">Sculpting tools haven't changed at all, they have just been added and the materials have changed. In the renaissance and even before then,
            marble, limestone, and granite have been used for sculpting, and these stones were carved into with a hammer and a chisel. Clays have been
            made with natural mineral clay under the surface of the earth, which is pulverized when dried and added to water so it can be molded. In the
            new invention of the kiln which replaced open fires, sculptures made of certain clays could be fired and preserved solid for good. When using
            clay, the tool list contains; ribbon tools, scrapers, fettling knives, sponges and ball tip shapers. They were originally made of wood,
            and soon molded to make metal tools.

        <h1>Boards </h1>
        <p class="paints">Boards have always been made from similar materials. At the very beginning, people would paint on stone walls, then on parchment. For the
            artists on topic, the oldest ones used parchment for sketches and studies and raw canvas for most paintings. Still today, canvases are used,
            but they are treated to stay stronger for longer. Canvases are stretched across wooden frames and tightened to be flat and not sink when you apply
            pressure. Wish street art, artists just paint on whatever they can, walls, floors, items, anything is a surface that can be painted. The world is
            your canvas.
